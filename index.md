## Welcome to my personal website, I am currently a computer science student at UCSD and will be graduating in Spring 2023

**I enjoy programming, gardening, embroidery, and volunteering with the non profit the Doris Dillon School in Cambodia.**

One of the quotes that resonates with me is from Juliette Gordon Low, the founder of Girl Scouts:
>"The work of today is the history of tomorrow and we are it's makers" 

I'd like to welcome you to my page with a : 

``` cout<<"Hello World!"; ```


I've made other websites in html and css before and hosted them on github pages, one of my favorites is [Pet The Cow](https://petthecow.com/)

Some of the classes I've taken at UCSD are: 
- CSE 100 
- CSE 140/L 
- LIGN 167 (Deep Learning)

I think some important actions that help with succeeding in classes at UCSD are:
1. Ask for help when you need it, from TAs, professors, and tutors
2. Try not to get behind, the quarter system is very fast so missing a class or a few can set you behind and make it difficult to succeed
3. Be sure to take care of yourself, making sure your health is good and taking time to relax for yourself so you don't burn out.

Some of my goals for this quarter are
- [ ] To do well in my classes
- [ ] Meet new people
- [ ] Try to have less stress
- [X] Get started early
